                No specific relevant codebase context was provided. You should still provide general best practices for component integration in a React/Next.js project.
                    

                    Based on the component description and common React/Next.js project structures (e.g., \`src/components\`, \`src/features/[featureName]/components\`, \`src/app\` or \`src/pages\` for pages), explain in detail, formatted in markdown:

                    1.  **Recommended Component File Path:**
                        Provide a specific, logical file path where this new component file should be placed. Justify your choice based on the component's purpose (e.g., common UI element, specific feature part, page component) and standard React/Next.js project organization. Example: \`src/components/common/MyNewComponent.tsx\` or \`src/features/user/components/UserProfileCard.tsx\`.

                    2.  **Basic Component Code Structure:**
                        Provide a basic React functional component code structure for the component. Include typical imports (e.g., 'react', 'react-dom/client' if needed, UI components from shadcn/ui if relevant) and a simple functional component definition. Use TypeScript if tsx is implied, otherwise plain JavaScript.
                        Example:
                        \`\`\`typescript
                        // src/components/common/Button.tsx
                        import React from 'react';

                        interface ButtonProps {
                          label: string;
                          onClick: () => void;
                        }

                        const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => {
                          return (
                            <button onClick={onClick} className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">
                              {label}
                            </button>
                          );
                        };

                        export default Button;
                        \`\`\`

                    3.  **Integration Steps & Example Usage:**
                        Clearly explain how this component should typically be integrated into other parts of the application. Provide a simple JSX example showing its usage. This might include:
                        -   Where it should be imported (e.g., in a parent page or another feature component).
                        -   How it should be rendered (JSX example).
                        -   Considerations for passing props.
                        -   Briefly mention if routing or state management is relevant for this type of component.

                    4.  **Dependencies & Best Practices:**
                        Suggest any immediate or likely external dependencies (e.g., other UI components like Button, hooks like useState/useEffect, external libraries). Mention general best practices for component design, naming, and reusability (e.g., keeping components focused, using props effectively, avoiding prop drilling).

                    If, after considering the provided description and context, you cannot provide a reasonable suggestion, state: "I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to provide a precise recommendation for adding this component."
                    Ensure all code snippets are within markdown code blocks (e.g., \`\`\`typescript ... \`\`\`).
